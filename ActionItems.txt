Database description: https://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/datasets.aspx

Next Steps
1. Improve structure of transformer model.
2. Try to see how far out in time we can project before losing accuracy.
3. Try other models (RNN, LSTM, Vision Transformer)
4. Try using SSIM loss rather than MSE for results presentation.
5. Increasing resolution of images.
6. Try existing model with Channel flow.  Also try with pressure instead of velocity.
7. Try a model that takes both pressure and velocity images as input, and see whether we can get a
   better (or longer) projection with both than with a single model applied to one at a time.
8. Try training a model with greatly increased resolution -- does it make a difference in either
   accuracy or duration.
9. Make sure we have a good understanding of the data captured in each database.
